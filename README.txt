 This game is a mash-up of the 1977 movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" and the game Simon, which debuted a year later in 1978.

In the movie, people attempt to communicate with visiting aliens by using a 72-key lightboard, as re-depicted here. 

You can play either the "conversation" sequence of tones from the movie, or a random, Simon-like sequence of tones.

Challenge yourself with strict playing mode where no mistakes are allowed!
 
Get 20 correct tones in a row, and you win :)
